## Description
* This repository contains an implementation of the Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm, a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the teaching and learning processes in a classroom.
* TLBO is designed to solve complex optimization problems by mimicking the way teachers and students interact in a learning environment.
